but not limited to, IoT hobbyists, developers, and gurus to make their own smart home programs or applications. 
 About the New Version 
 We will stop adding support for new products on   as we release  . 
 Hence, we strongly recommend all SwitchBot users to migrate to the new API version because we have improved the authentication method. This will make the communication between your server and the SwitchBot server more secure. 
 Getting Started 
 Please follow these steps, 
 
 
 Download the SwitchBot app on App Store or Google Play Store 
 
 
 Register a SwitchBot account and log in into your account 
 
 
 Generate an Open Token within the app
For app version ≥ V9.0,
a) Go to Profile > Preferences > About
b) Tap App Version 10 times. Developer Options will show up
c) Tap Developer Options
d) Tap Get Token 
 
 
 For app version < V9.0,
a) Go to Profile > Preferences
b) Tap App Version 10 times. Developer Options will show up
c) Tap Developer Options
d) Tap Get Token 
 
 Roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty with SwitchBot OpenAPI! 
 
 Authentication 
 Open Token and Secret Key 
 Note: You must update the app to the latest version,   or later, in order to get the secret key. 
 In SwitchBot API  , the authentication method has been improved. In order to gain access to private data through the API, you must generate a unique signature using a token and a secret key. When you make a request, the Authorization token and signature will be validated simultaneously. 
 You as a developer will then be able to add, delete, edit, and look up your data including profile data and data associated with the devices that have been added to your SwitchBot account. 
 To continue to use SwitchBot API  , refer to the legacy document. 
 How to Sign? 
 We have attached some scripts for you to quickly generate a sign. If you prefer to write your own script or routine, here is the procedure.

 Open Token and Secret Key 
 Note: You must update the app to the latest version,  V6.14  or later, in order to get the secret key. 
 In SwitchBot API  v1.1 , the authentication method has been improved. In order to gain access to private data through the API, you must generate a unique signature using a token and a secret key. When you make a request, the Authorization token and signature will be validated simultaneously. 
 You as a developer will then be able to add, delete, edit, and look up your data including profile data and data associated with the devices that have been added to your SwitchBot account.

 The control commands for this product work differently than the other products. Due to security concerns, the passcodes are stored locally. This mechanism dramatically prolongs the time needed to successfully create a passcode and get the correct result through the Web API. Hence, the actual results of the following commands are returned from the SwitchBot server asynchronously and are delivered through a webhook. 
 You need to configure a webhook to receive the correct result. Refer to this product's webhook definition.

  Cloud Services 
 
 Important note: Beyond V9.0, there will NOT be a Cloud Services option in the app. You will see Third-party Services instead. Please read this article for more information,  https://support.switch-bot.com/hc/en-us/articles/7257579858455 
 
 A SwitchBot app feature, which appears in the app <V9.0 that 
 
 Enables SwitchBot products to be discovered and communicated with third-party services such as Home Assistant, Alexa, Google Home, IFTTT, SmartThings, and so forth 
 Allows users to create customized smart scenes and  widgets. For BLE-based devices such as Bot and Curtain 
 You MUST first add a SwitchBot Hub such as Hub 2, Hub Mini with Matter Enabled, or Hub Mini 
 Then enable Cloud Services on the Settings page in order to make use of the web API!

 Introduction 
 This document describes a collection of SwitchBot API methods, examples, and best practices for, but not limited to, IoT hobbyists, developers, and gurus to make their own smart home programs or applications. 
 Getting Started 
 Please follow these steps, 
 
 Download the SwitchBot app on App Store or Google Play Store 
 Register a SwitchBot account and log in into your account 
 Generate an Open Token within the app
a) Go to Profile > Preference
b) Tap App Version 10 times. Developer Options will show up
c) Tap Developer Options
d) Tap Get Token 
 Roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty with SwitchBot OpenAPI! 
 
 Authentication 
 Open Token 
 The token returned from the SwitchBot Cloud is an encrypted open token that grants the user developer-level permissions.
Context number 2 (score: 0.753811181): 
422 
 Unprocessable Entity 
 The client has made a valid request, but the server cannot process it. This is often used for APIs for which certain limits have been exceeded. 
 
 
 429 
 Too Many Requests 
 The client has exceeded the number of requests allowed for a given time window. 
 
 
 500 
 Internal Server Error 
 An unexpected error on the SmartThings servers has occurred. These errors should be rare. 
 
 
 
 Devices 
 The devices API is used to access the properties and states of SwitchBot devices and to send control commands to those devices. 
 Get device list 
 
 Description 
 Get a list of devices, which include physical devices and virtual infrared remote devices that have been added to the current user's account. 
 Physical devices refer to the following SwitchBot products, 
 
 Hub 
 Hub Plus 
 Hub Mini 
 Bot (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Curtain (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Plug 
 Meter (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Motion Sensor (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Contact Sensor (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Color Bulb 
 Humidifier 
 Smart Fan 
 Strip Light 
 Plug Mini (US) 
 Plug Mini (JP) 
 Lock 
 Meter Plus (JP) (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Meter Plus (US) (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
  Robot Vacuum Cleaner S1 
  Robot Vacuum Cleaner S1 Plus 
 
 Virtual infrared remote devices refer to virtual devices that are used to simulate infrared signals of a home appliance remote control. A SwitchBot Hub Plus / Hub Mini is required in order to be able to create these virtual devices within the app.
