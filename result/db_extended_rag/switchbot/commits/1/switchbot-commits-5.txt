In this updated code:

- I updated the API endpoints to use version "v1.1".
- I added necessary logic for signature generation using HMAC SHA-256 as part of the new authentication method.
- Assumed that the secret key is part of the configuration to enable this signature creation.

 About the New Version 
 We will stop adding support for new products on   as we release  . 
 Hence, we strongly recommend all SwitchBot users to migrate to the new API version because we have improved the authentication method. This will make the communication between your server and the SwitchBot server more secure. 
 Getting Started 
 Please follow these steps, 
 
 
 Download the SwitchBot app on App Store or Google Play Store 
 
 
 Register a SwitchBot account and log in into your account

 Authentication 
 Open Token and Secret Key 
 Note: You must update the app to the latest version,   or later, in order to get the secret key. 
 In SwitchBot API  , the authentication method has been improved. In order to gain access to private data through the API, you must generate a unique signature using a token and a secret key. When you make a request, the Authorization token and signature will be validated simultaneously. 
 You as a developer will then be able to add, delete, edit, and look up your data including profile data and data associated with the devices that have been added to your SwitchBot account. 
 To continue to use SwitchBot API  , refer to the legacy document.

 Introduction 
 This document describes a collection of SwitchBot API methods, examples, and best practices for, but not limited to, IoT hobbyists, developers, and gurus to make their own smart home programs or applications. 
 Getting Started 
 Please follow these steps, 
 
 Download the SwitchBot app on App Store or Google Play Store 
 Register a SwitchBot account and log in into your account 
 Generate an Open Token within the app
a) Go to Profile > Preference
b) Tap App Version 10 times. Developer Options will show up
c) Tap Developer Options
d) Tap Get Token 
 Roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty with SwitchBot OpenAPI! 
 
 Authentication 
 Open Token 
 The token returned from the SwitchBot Cloud is an encrypted open token that grants the user developer-level permissions.
Context number 2 (score: 0.79530108): 
422 
 Unprocessable Entity 
 The client has made a valid request, but the server cannot process it. This is often used for APIs for which certain limits have been exceeded. 
 
 
 429 
 Too Many Requests 
 The client has exceeded the number of requests allowed for a given time window. 
 
 
 500 
 Internal Server Error 
 An unexpected error on the SmartThings servers has occurred. These errors should be rare. 
 
 
 
 Devices 
 The devices API is used to access the properties and states of SwitchBot devices and to send control commands to those devices. 
 Get device list 
 
 Description 
 Get a list of devices, which include physical devices and virtual infrared remote devices that have been added to the current user's account. 
 Physical devices refer to the following SwitchBot products, 
 
 Hub 
 Hub Plus 
 Hub Mini 
 Bot (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Curtain (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Plug 
 Meter (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Motion Sensor (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Contact Sensor (MUST enable Cloud Service first) 
 Color Bulb 
 Humidifier 
 Smart Fan 
 Strip Light
