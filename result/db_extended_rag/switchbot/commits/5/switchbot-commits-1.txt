### Key Changes:

1. **Endpoint Version Update**: The base endpoint was updated to use `v1.1` instead of `v1.0`.
2. **CommandType for Infrared Remote**: The `commandType` for sending a `turnOff` command to an infrared remote device was updated from an empty string to `'customize'`.

 Note: Most of the devices support  turnOn  or  turnOff , which are case-sensitive. For infrared remote devices, when you have created customized buttons, you must set  commandType  to  customize , otherwise the command will not work.  command  needs to be set to the name of the customized button.

 The control commands for this product work differently than the other products. Due to security concerns, the passcodes are stored locally. This mechanism dramatically prolongs the time needed to successfully create a passcode and get the correct result through the Web API. Hence, the actual results of the following commands are returned from the SwitchBot server asynchronously and are delivered through a webhook. 
 You need to configure a webhook to receive the correct result. Refer to this product's webhook definition.

 About the New Version 
 We will stop adding support for new products on  v1.0  as we release  v1.1 . 
 Hence, we strongly recommend all SwitchBot users to migrate to the new API version because we have improved the authentication method. This will make the communication between your server and the SwitchBot server more secure. 
 Getting Started 
 Please follow these steps, 
 
 
 Download the SwitchBot app on App Store or Google Play Store 
 
 
 Register a SwitchBot account and log in into your account 
 
 
 Generate an Open Token within the app
For app version ≥ V9.0,
a) Go to Profile > Preferences > About
b) Tap App Version 10 times. Developer Options will show up
c) Tap Developer Options
d) Tap Get Token 
 
 
 For app version < V9.0,
a) Go to Profile > Preferences
b) Tap App Version 10 times. Developer Options will show up
c) Tap Developer Options
d) Tap Get Token 
 
 Roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty with SwitchBot OpenAPI! 
 
 Authentication 
 Open Token and Secret Key 
 Note: You must update the app to the latest version,  V6.14  or later, in order to get the secret key. 
 In SwitchBot API  v1.1 , the authentication method has been improved. In order to gain access to private data through the API, you must generate a unique signature using a token and a secret key. When you make a request, the Authorization token and signature will be validated simultaneously. 
 You as a developer will then be able to add, delete, edit, and look up your data including profile data and data associated with the devices that have been added to your SwitchBot account. 
 To continue to use SwitchBot API  v1.0 , refer to the legacy document. 
 How to Sign? 
 We have attached some scripts for you to quickly generate a sign. If you prefer to write your own script or routine, here is the procedure.

 Introduction 
 This document describes a collection of SwitchBot API methods, examples, and best practices for, but not limited to, IoT hobbyists, developers, and gurus to make their own smart home programs or applications. 
 Getting Started 
 Please follow these steps, 
 
 Download the SwitchBot app on App Store or Google Play Store 
 Register a SwitchBot account and log in into your account 
 Generate an Open Token within the app
a) Go to Profile > Preference
b) Tap App Version 10 times. Developer Options will show up
c) Tap Developer Options
d) Tap Get Token 
 Roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty with SwitchBot OpenAPI! 
 
 Authentication 
 Open Token 
 The token returned from the SwitchBot Cloud is an encrypted open token that grants the user developer-level permissions.
