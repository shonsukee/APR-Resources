# Client Credentials Grant Flow

The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:

  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)).  
This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE].

  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).

Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.

The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:

  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.

## Additional Information

### JSON Web Tokens

Fitbit API access tokens use the JSON Web Token (JWT) format. Fitbit reserves
the right to change the contents and format of these tokens at any time.
Client applications should not create dependencies upon the token format.

Access tokens and refresh tokens may be up to 1,024 bytes in size.

### Web Browser Compatibility

The Fitbit API and its implementation of OAuth 2.0 are designed to work with
the current and one previous version of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft
Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. When a new version of a web browser is released,
Fitbit begins supporting that version and stop supporting the third most
recent version.

Context number 5 (score: 0.812862158): 
## Additional Information

An access token intentionally is short lived. This is an important security
mechanism of OAuth 2.0. When using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE]. By default, the access tokens have an eight-hour lifetime.

When an access token expires, an HTTP 401 error will be returned.

    
    
    {
      "errors": [
        {
          "errorType": "expired_token",
          "message": "Access token expired: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...."
        }
      ]
    }
    

At this point, your application needs to refresh the access token. The Fitbit
API follows
[RFC6749](https<nolink>://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6)
specification for refreshing access tokens. A refresh token does not expire
until it is used. The refresh token can only be used once, as a new refresh
token is returned with the new access token.

If the application makes identical refresh token requests within a two-minute
period, the Fitbit Web API will return the same response. This is to assist
applications unable to coordinate the refresh token flow between processes.

Alternatively, your application could redirect the user to the authentication
flow. If the user is signed in and the scopes requested match the previously
granted scopes, the user will be redirected to your redirect URL with a new
access token without being prompted.

## Additional Information

### Webhook notifications

The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.

The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

## Additional Information

### Revoked tokens

Users have granular control over read/write access to their data through the
Fitbit Web API. When a user revokes consent to your application, their access
token becomes invalid and your access to that user's data through the Web API
is no longer available. What you do with the data that has already been
collected should be clearly documented in your Terms of Service and Privacy
Policy. Any guidelines or requirements defined by Fitbit will be specified in
our [Platform Terms of Service](https://dev.fitbit.com/legal/platform-terms-
of-service/).

### Revoking refresh tokens

When a `/oauth2/revoke` request is made with a refresh_token that is not
present in our database, the service will respond with an HTTP status code of
404 (NOT_FOUND).

## Additional Information

### Device support

The Fitbit devices have the ability to set an alarm. Older devices whose
alarms are configured in the mobile application support the create, delete,
get and update alarm endpoints. Newer devices, listed in this help article
<https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1868.htm>, contain an on-
device alarm application, and do not support the alarm endpoints. The alarms
for these devices can only be set on the device itself.

Setting an alarm without a recurring schedule is intended for next day
purposes only.

## Additional Information

### Localizing the consent page

The Fitbit consent page supports localization. Since it is just a web form,
the text is translated based on the user's "Language by Region/Country"
setting in their Fitbit account. The user's device or browser language
settings may translate the consent language, as well. We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

## Additional Information

The response includes all badges for the user as seen on the Fitbit website
badge locker (both activity and weight related). The endpoint returns weight
and distance badges based on the user's unit profile preference as on the
website.

**Privacy Settings**  

There are two privacy settings to consider for the response data:

  1. The **My Achievements** (Friends or Anyone) privacy permission grants access to other user's resource. 
  2. The **My Body** (Friends or Anyone) privacy permission reveals weight badge data in response.

### Webhook notifications

The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.

The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

 Response 
 A successful request will return a  204  status code with an empty response
body. 
 Sleep Time Series (Deprecated) 
 Note:  This API has been deprecated with the introduction of version 1.2 of
the Sleep APIs described above. Sleep Stages data cannot be retrieved with this
API. If your application requires data consistency while you transition over to
the version 1.2 Sleep APIs, you can get this data through the  version 1 Get
Sleep Logs by Date
endpoint . 
 The  Get Sleep Time Series  endpoint returns time series data in the specified
range for a given resource in the format requested using units in the  unit
system  that corresponds to the Accept-Language
header provided. 
 Note:  Even if you provide earlier dates in the request, the response
retrieves only data since the user's join date or the first log entry date for
the requested collection.

Sleep Logs Version 1 (Deprecated) 
 Overview 
 These endpoints are deprecated and support for them may end unexpectedly. If
your application does not depend on the sleep as calculated by these endpoints,
please use the new  v1.2 sleep endpoints . 
 
 Note : Version 1 APIs  do not  support Sleep Stages data 
 
 Get Sleep Logs by Date 
 The  Get Sleep Logs by Date  endpoint returns a summary and list of a user's
