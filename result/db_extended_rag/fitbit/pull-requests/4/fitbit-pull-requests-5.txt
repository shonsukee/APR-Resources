## Additional Information

The authenticated owner receives all values in the response body. The
authenticated user's access to other users' data is subject to those users'
privacy settings. To retrieve the profile information of the authenticated
owner's friends, use the [Get Friends endpoint](/build/reference/web-
api/friends/get-friends). Numerical values are returned in the unit system
specified in the Accept-Language header.

**Considerations**  

  1. The fullName field is present at all times. It contains one of the following:
     * The user's fullName.
     * A portion of user's email address before the at sign, "@". This is used in the case where the fullName field is empty.
  2. The Units fields (distanceUnit, glucoseUnit, etc.) represent the default unit settings configured for the user. These fields are used as the default for all other body measurements (such as neck, bicep, etc.).

## Additional Information

### JSON Web Tokens

Fitbit API access tokens use the JSON Web Token (JWT) format. Fitbit reserves
the right to change the contents and format of these tokens at any time.
Client applications should not create dependencies upon the token format.

Access tokens and refresh tokens may be up to 1,024 bytes in size.

### Web Browser Compatibility

The Fitbit API and its implementation of OAuth 2.0 are designed to work with
the current and one previous version of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft
Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. When a new version of a web browser is released,
Fitbit begins supporting that version and stop supporting the third most
recent version.

The response includes all badges for the user as seen on the Fitbit website
badge locker (both activity and weight related). The endpoint returns weight
and distance badges based on the user's unit profile preference as on the
website.

There are two privacy settings to consider for the response data:

  1. The **My Achievements** (Friends or Anyone) privacy permission grants access to other user's resource. 
  2. The **My Body** (Friends or Anyone) privacy permission reveals weight badge data in response.

# Client Credentials Grant Flow

The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:

  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)).  
This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with

  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).

Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.

The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:

  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.

**Body Parameters**  
**grant_type**  
_required_ | **Supported:** client_credentials **Type:** string

||  
accept | optional | The media type of the response content the client is expecting.
Context number 8 (score: 0.792080581): 
## Additional Information

An access token intentionally is short lived. This is an important security
mechanism of OAuth 2.0. When using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE]. By default, the access tokens have an eight-hour lifetime.

When an access token expires, an HTTP 401 error will be returned.

    
    
    {
      "errors": [
        {
          "errorType": "expired_token",
          "message": "Access token expired: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...."
        }
      ]
    }
    

At this point, your application needs to refresh the access token. The Fitbit
API follows
[RFC6749](https<nolink>://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6)
specification for refreshing access tokens. A refresh token does not expire
until it is used. The refresh token can only be used once, as a new refresh
token is returned with the new access token.

If the application makes identical refresh token requests within a two-minute
period, the Fitbit Web API will return the same response. This is to assist
applications unable to coordinate the refresh token flow between processes.

Alternatively, your application could redirect the user to the authentication
flow. If the user is signed in and the scopes requested match the previously
granted scopes, the user will be redirected to your redirect URL with a new
access token without being prompted.

The Fitbit consent page supports localization. Since it is just a web form,
the text is translated based on the user's "Language by Region/Country"
setting in their Fitbit account. The user's device or browser language
settings may translate the consent language, as well. We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

## Additional Information

### Webhook notifications

The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.

The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the

### Webhook notifications

The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.

The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

### Device compatibility

The SpO2 data is retrieved from the user’s Fitbit account. This gives the user
secure and transparent control over their data. The data is then processed and
made available through the API after the user syncs their device with the
Fitbit data service.

Most of the current devices sold support SpO2 data collection. See the [Fitbit
Product](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products) page to determine if your
specific device supports SpO2.

### Measurement units

SpO2 measurements are calculated as percentages. This is because blood oxygen
saturation levels are most commonly and easily understood by users when
referred to as percentages.

## Additional Information

Authorized user (self) is also included in the response. Leaderboard has the
last seven (7) days worth of data (the previous six days plus today's date) in
real time.

The **Average Daily Step Count** privacy setting in the Fitbit user's profile
settings allows a user to be included to Friends leaderboard whether they hide
themselves on their profile settings or not.

### Inviting friends

Fitbit does not offer endpoints that can send or respond to friend invitation
requests. The Fitbit user must send friend requests through the mobile
application or Fitbit.com. See [How do I connect with friends on
