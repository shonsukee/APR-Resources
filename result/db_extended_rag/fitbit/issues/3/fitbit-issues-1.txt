# OAuth2 Token

The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:

  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)). This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow.
  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).

* * *

|  
  
**Body Parameters**  
**code**  
_required_ | The authorization code received in the redirect as a URI parameter. The authorization code is only valid for 10 minutes. **Type:** string  
|  
**grant_type**  
_required_ | **Supported:** `authorization_code` **Type:** string  
**client_id**  
_required for client apps_ | This is your Fitbit API application ID from your settings on <https://dev.fitbit.com>. Apps set to type "client" should use this to pass their ID instead of the Authorization header. **Type:** string  
**redirect_uri**  
_recommended / required_ | Required if specified in the redirect to the authorization page. Must be exact match. **Type:** URI  
**expires_in**  
_optional_ | Specifies the desired access token lifetime.  `28800` for 8 hours **Supported:** 28800 **Type:** integer  
**code_verifier**  
(For use with PKCE only)  
_required_ | The code verifier is used to derive the code challenge while obtaining the access code in the authorization request. This string is the base64url-encoding of a cryptographically, random-generated octet sequence. **Type:** string  
  
**Request Headers** authorization | (For use with server apps only)  
required | Must be set to Basic followed by a space, then the Base64 encoded string of your application's client id and secret concatenated with a colon. For example, the Base64 encoded string, **Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudCBzZWNyZXQ=** , is decoded as **"client_id:client secret"**. **Token type:** `Basic`

Context number 2 (score: 0.787096918): 
## Additional Information

An access token intentionally is short lived. This is an important security
mechanism of OAuth 2.0. When using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE]. By default, the access tokens have an eight-hour lifetime.

When an access token expires, an HTTP 401 error will be returned.

    
    
    {
      "errors": [
        {
          "errorType": "expired_token",
          "message": "Access token expired: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...."
        }
      ]
    }
    

At this point, your application needs to refresh the access token. The Fitbit
API follows
[RFC6749](https<nolink>://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6)
specification for refreshing access tokens. A refresh token does not expire
until it is used. The refresh token can only be used once, as a new refresh
token is returned with the new access token.

If the application makes identical refresh token requests within a two-minute
period, the Fitbit Web API will return the same response. This is to assist
applications unable to coordinate the refresh token flow between processes.

Alternatively, your application could redirect the user to the authentication
flow. If the user is signed in and the scopes requested match the previously
granted scopes, the user will be redirected to your redirect URL with a new
access token without being prompted.

## Additional Information

### JSON Web Tokens

Fitbit API access tokens use the JSON Web Token (JWT) format. Fitbit reserves
the right to change the contents and format of these tokens at any time.
Client applications should not create dependencies upon the token format.

Access tokens and refresh tokens may be up to 1,024 bytes in size.

### Web Browser Compatibility

The Fitbit API and its implementation of OAuth 2.0 are designed to work with
the current and one previous version of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft
Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. When a new version of a web browser is released,
Fitbit begins supporting that version and stop supporting the third most
recent version.

# Client Credentials Grant Flow

The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:

  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)).  
This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with

  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).

Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.

The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:

  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.

## Additional Information

### Localizing the consent page

The Fitbit consent page supports localization. Since it is just a web form,
the text is translated based on the user's "Language by Region/Country"
setting in their Fitbit account. The user's device or browser language
settings may translate the consent language, as well. We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

## Additional Information

### Webhook notifications

The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.

The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

### Revoked tokens

Users have granular control over read/write access to their data through the
Fitbit Web API. When a user revokes consent to your application, their access
token becomes invalid and your access to that user's data through the Web API
is no longer available. What you do with the data that has already been
collected should be clearly documented in your Terms of Service and Privacy
Policy. Any guidelines or requirements defined by Fitbit will be specified in
our [Platform Terms of Service](https://dev.fitbit.com/legal/platform-terms-
of-service/).

### Revoking refresh tokens

When a `/oauth2/revoke` request is made with a refresh_token that is not

### Device support

The Fitbit devices have the ability to set an alarm. Older devices whose
alarms are configured in the mobile application support the create, delete,
get and update alarm endpoints. Newer devices, listed in this help article
<https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1868.htm>, contain an on-
device alarm application, and do not support the alarm endpoints. The alarms
for these devices can only be set on the device itself.

Setting an alarm without a recurring schedule is intended for next day
purposes only.

**Response Headers**  
content-type | The media type of the response content being sent to the client.  
**Supported:** `application/json`  
|  
fitbit-rate-limit-limit | The quota number of calls.  
fitbit-rate-limit-remaining | The number of calls remaining before hitting the rate limit.  
fitbit-rate-limit-reset | The number of seconds until the rate limit resets.  
  
> **Note:** The rate limit headers are approximate and asynchronously updated.
> This means that there may be a minor delay in the decrementing of remaining
> requests. This could result in your application receiving an unexpected 429

**Response Type**  

HTTP Status Code | HTTP response code. List of codes are found in the [Troubleshooting Guide](/build/reference/web-api/troubleshooting-guide/error-messages/).  
|  
Status Message | Description of the status code.  
Response Body | Contains the JSON response to the API call. When errors are returned by the API call, the errorType, fieldName and message text will provide more information to the cause of the failure.  
  
**Response Codes**  
200 | A successful request.  
|  
400 | The request had bad syntax or was inherently impossible to be satisfied.  
401 | The request requires user authentication.
Context number 16 (score: 0.747529268): 
The space in this parameter value needs to be URL encoded. **Type:** string  
**state**  
_recommended_ | Provides any state that might be useful to your application when the user is redirected back to your application. This parameter will be added to the redirect URI exactly as your application specifies. Fitbit strongly recommend including an anti-forgery token in this parameter and confirming its value in the redirect to mitigate against cross-site request forgery (CSRF). **Type:** string  
**code_challenge**  
(For use with PKCE only)  
_optional / required_ | The code challenge is derived from the code verifier by using a transformation on the code verifier. The code verifier is a cryptographically random string dynamically created for each authorization request. The available transformations are `S256 ` and `plain`. `S256`: must be used if supported by the client:  
_code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(code_verifier)))_.  
  
`plain`: does not mitigate as wide a range of attacks as `S256` and may be
used only if the client cannot technically support `S256`: _code_challenge =
code_verifier_. **Default:** plain **Type:** string  
**code_challenge_method**  
(For use with PKCE only)  
_optional_ | Code verifier transformation method is `S256` or `plain`. **Default:** plain **Type:** string

## Additional Information

#### Access Levels

There are 2 access level types for food log entries that an authorized user
can view via API requests. Each food is annotated with an **accessLevel**
field with one of the following values:

  * PUBLIC - Foods that are in Fitbit's public food database and are visible to any Fitbit users. Only Fitbit populates this database to avoid **spam** and **duplicate entries**.
  * PRIVATE - Foods created by a user either on the website or via the [Create Food](/build/reference/web-api/nutrition/create-food/) endpoint.
