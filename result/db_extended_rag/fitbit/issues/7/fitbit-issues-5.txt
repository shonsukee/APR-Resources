## Additional Information

### JSON Web Tokens

Fitbit API access tokens use the JSON Web Token (JWT) format. Fitbit reserves
the right to change the contents and format of these tokens at any time.
Client applications should not create dependencies upon the token format.

Access tokens and refresh tokens may be up to 1,024 bytes in size.

### Web Browser Compatibility

The Fitbit API and its implementation of OAuth 2.0 are designed to work with
the current and one previous version of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft
Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. When a new version of a web browser is released,
Fitbit begins supporting that version and stop supporting the third most
recent version.

Context number 5 (score: 0.829843402): 
## Additional Information

An access token intentionally is short lived. This is an important security
mechanism of OAuth 2.0. When using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE]. By default, the access tokens have an eight-hour lifetime.

When an access token expires, an HTTP 401 error will be returned.

    
    
    {
      "errors": [
        {
          "errorType": "expired_token",
          "message": "Access token expired: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...."
        }
      ]
    }
    

At this point, your application needs to refresh the access token. The Fitbit
API follows
[RFC6749](https<nolink>://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6)
specification for refreshing access tokens. A refresh token does not expire
until it is used. The refresh token can only be used once, as a new refresh
token is returned with the new access token.

If the application makes identical refresh token requests within a two-minute
period, the Fitbit Web API will return the same response. This is to assist
applications unable to coordinate the refresh token flow between processes.

Alternatively, your application could redirect the user to the authentication
flow. If the user is signed in and the scopes requested match the previously
granted scopes, the user will be redirected to your redirect URL with a new
access token without being prompted.

# Client Credentials Grant Flow

The /oauth2/token endpoint can do the following:

  * Exchange the authorization code for the initial access token and refresh token (See [OAuth2 Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/oauth2-token)).  
This process is required when using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE].

  * Obtain a new access token and refresh token when the existing access token has expired (See [Refresh Token](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/refresh-token/)).
  * Initiate the Client Credentials authorization flow (See [Client Credentials](/build/reference/web-api/authorization/client-credentials/)).

Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.

The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:

  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.

## Additional Information

### Localizing the consent page

The Fitbit consent page supports localization. Since it is just a web form,
the text is translated based on the user's "Language by Region/Country"
setting in their Fitbit account. The user's device or browser language
settings may translate the consent language, as well. We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

## Additional Information

### Revoked tokens

Users have granular control over read/write access to their data through the
Fitbit Web API. When a user revokes consent to your application, their access
token becomes invalid and your access to that user's data through the Web API
is no longer available. What you do with the data that has already been
collected should be clearly documented in your Terms of Service and Privacy
Policy. Any guidelines or requirements defined by Fitbit will be specified in
our [Platform Terms of Service](https://dev.fitbit.com/legal/platform-terms-
of-service/).

### Revoking refresh tokens

When a `/oauth2/revoke` request is made with a refresh_token that is not
present in our database, the service will respond with an HTTP status code of
404 (NOT_FOUND).

 Response 
 A successful request will return a  204  status code with an empty response
body. 
 Sleep Time Series (Deprecated) 
 Note:  This API has been deprecated with the introduction of version 1.2 of
the Sleep APIs described above. Sleep Stages data cannot be retrieved with this
API. If your application requires data consistency while you transition over to
the version 1.2 Sleep APIs, you can get this data through the  version 1 Get
Sleep Logs by Date
endpoint . 
 The  Get Sleep Time Series  endpoint returns time series data in the specified
range for a given resource in the format requested using units in the  unit
system  that corresponds to the Accept-Language
header provided. 
 Note:  Even if you provide earlier dates in the request, the response
retrieves only data since the user's join date or the first log entry date for
the requested collection. 
 Resource URL 
 There are two acceptable formats for retrieving intraday data: 
 
 
 
       api-version   The API

Sleep Logs Version 1 (Deprecated) 
 Overview 
 These endpoints are deprecated and support for them may end unexpectedly. If
your application does not depend on the sleep as calculated by these endpoints,
please use the new  v1.2 sleep endpoints . 
 
 Note : Version 1 APIs  do not  support Sleep Stages data 
 
 Get Sleep Logs by Date 
 The  Get Sleep Logs by Date  endpoint returns a summary and list of a user's
sleep log entries (including naps) as well as detailed sleep entry data for a
given day. 
 The relationship between sleep log entry properties is expressed with the
following equation: 
 
 
 
 Resource URL 
 
 
 
 URL parameters: 
       user-id   The ID of the user.
    Use "-" (dash) for current logged-in user.       date 
 The date of records to be returned. In the format  yyyy-MM-dd . 
     
 Example Request 
 
 
 
 Example Response 
 Note:  The text within the brackets  <>  is a descriptive placeholder for a
value or repeated elements. Also, values for  minuteData  can be  1 
("asleep"),  2  ("restless"), or  3  ("awake"). 
 
 
 
 Log Sleep 
 The  Log Sleep  endpoint creates a log entry for a sleep event and returns a
response in the format requested. Keep in mind that it is  NOT  possible to
create overlapping log entries. The  dateOfSleep  in the response for the
sleep log is the date on which the sleep event ends.
