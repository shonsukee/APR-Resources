---------------Response---------------
To modify the code and bring it up to the latest Fitbit API specifications, the outdated authorization process using OAuth1.0 needs to be updated to OAuth2.0. Below is the modified code in which the OAuth authorization mechanism is updated according to the latest specifications:

```ruby
module Fitgem
  class Client
    API_VERSION = '1'
    EMPTY_BODY = ''

    # Start the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow
    #
    # @param [String] client_id The Fitbit API application id
    # @param [String] redirect_uri Where Fitbit should send the user after the grant
    # @param [String] scope A space-delimited list of permissions
    # @return [String] The authorization URL
    def authorize(client_id, redirect_uri, scope)
      "https://www.fitbit.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=#{client_id}&redirect_uri=#{ERB::Util.url_encode(redirect_uri)}&scope=#{ERB::Util.url_encode(scope)}"
    end

    # Obtain access token using authorization code
    #
    # @param [String] code The authorization code
    # @param [String] redirect_uri The redirect URI used in the authorization request
    # @param [String] client_id The Fitbit API application id
    # @param [String] client_secret The Fitbit API application's client secret
    # @return [Hash] The access token response data
    def get_access_token(code, redirect_uri, client_id, client_secret)
      uri = URI.parse('https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token')
      request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri)
      request.basic_auth(client_id, client_secret)
      request.set_form_data(
        'grant_type' => 'authorization_code',
        'code' => code,
        'redirect_uri' => redirect_uri
      )
      request['Content-Type'] = 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'

      response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
        http.request(request)
      end

      JSON.parse(response.body)
    end

    private

      def consumer
        @consumer ||= OAuth::Consumer.new(@consumer_key, @consumer_secret, {
          :site => 'https://api.fitbit.com',
          :authorize_url => 'https://www.fitbit.com/oauth2/authorize'
        })
      end
  end
end
```

Key changes:
- Removed the outdated `OAuth::RequestToken` method for authorization.
- Introduced methods for OAuth 2.0 authorization and token exchange (`authorize` and `get_access_token`).
- Updated endpoints and parameters to conform to OAuth 2.0 requirements as per the latest Fitbit API documentation.
- Replaced OAuth 1.0 token retrieval with an authorization URL generation for OAuth 2.0 and access token exchange.

Fitbit follows the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow as specified in [RFC
6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4). This
authorization flow is used with specific Fitbit API endpoints related to
business operations. It is not supported by the public Web APIs to retrieve
Fitbit user data.

The Client Credentials Grant flow has the following steps:

  1. The application sends a request to https://api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token with its client_id and client_secret; and
  2. Fitbit authenticates your application and issues an access token.

## Additional Information

### JSON Web Tokens

Fitbit API access tokens use the JSON Web Token (JWT) format. Fitbit reserves
the right to change the contents and format of these tokens at any time.
Client applications should not create dependencies upon the token format.

Access tokens and refresh tokens may be up to 1,024 bytes in size.

### Web Browser Compatibility

The Fitbit API and its implementation of OAuth 2.0 are designed to work with
the current and one previous version of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft
Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. When a new version of a web browser is released,
Fitbit begins supporting that version and stop supporting the third most
recent version.

## Additional Information

### Localizing the consent page

The Fitbit consent page supports localization. Since it is just a web form,
the text is translated based on the user's "Language by Region/Country"
setting in their Fitbit account. The user's device or browser language
settings may translate the consent language, as well. We do not support a
query parameter that forces language conversion.

Context number 10 (score: 0.786050498): 
## Additional Information

An access token intentionally is short lived. This is an important security
mechanism of OAuth 2.0. When using the Authorization Code Grant Flow [with
PKCE]. By default, the access tokens have an eight-hour lifetime.

When an access token expires, an HTTP 401 error will be returned.

    
    
    {
      "errors": [
        {
          "errorType": "expired_token",
          "message": "Access token expired: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...."
        }
      ]
    }
    

At this point, your application needs to refresh the access token. The Fitbit
API follows
[RFC6749](https<nolink>://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-6)
specification for refreshing access tokens. A refresh token does not expire
until it is used. The refresh token can only be used once, as a new refresh
token is returned with the new access token.

If the application makes identical refresh token requests within a two-minute
period, the Fitbit Web API will return the same response. This is to assist
applications unable to coordinate the refresh token flow between processes.

Alternatively, your application could redirect the user to the authentication
flow. If the user is signed in and the scopes requested match the previously
granted scopes, the user will be redirected to your redirect URL with a new
access token without being prompted.

## Additional Information

### Inactive tokens

When the introspect endpoint response returns "active = false", the token in
parameter is not active.  
[RFC 7662 section
2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662#section-2.2) clearly states
that the authorization server should not provide any more detail about the
reason for the inactive token. However, it is common that inactive tokens have
either expired or been revoked.

# Revoke Token

Used to disable a user's authorization for an application. The revoke
endpoint, specifying either the access token or refresh token, will remove the
user's authorizations and all associated tokens. This endpoint conforms to
[RFC 7009](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009).

Revoking the access token or refresh token will provide the same result. When
the token is revoked, all tokens are revoked for that user. If an application
has multiple sessions (web, mobile, etc.) for the same user, the revocation
will remove all sessions (web, mobile, etc.) associated with that user.

In addition, a revocation request can be made for tokens used by public
clients. The Authorization header is not used. Instead, the public client's
client_id and associated token will need to be specified as parameters in the
revocation request.

|  
  
**Body Parameters**  
**token**  
_required_ | The access_token or refresh_token to be revoked, or The access_token or refresh_token to be revoked on the associated public client. **Type:** string

_optional_ | The public client's client_id. **Type:** string  
  
**Request Headers** authorization | (For use with server apps only)  
required | Must be set to Basic followed by a space, then the Base64 encoded string of your application's client id and secret concatenated with a colon. For example, the Base64 encoded string, **Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudCBzZWNyZXQ=** , is decoded as **"client_id:client secret"**. **Token type:** `Basic`

## Additional Information

### Webhook notifications

The Fitbit Web API can send notifications when a Fitbit user has new data to
download. This is possible by implementing the Subscription API and
subscribing to one or more data collections. See [ Using
Subscriptions](/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/).
Whenever the activity service recognizes a change to the user’s data, a
notification is sent to your application’s subscriber.

The activity collection recognizes changes to a user’s recorded activities,
step count, calories burned, distance traveled, etc. Keep in mind that even
when a person is not in motion, their body is burning calories. It’s possible
to receive activity notifications representing calorie burn even when the user
is sleeping or stationary. Today, you cannot subscribe to a subset of the
user’s activity data. So, it is the responsibility of your application to
query the necessary activity endpoint(s) to reconcile the data in your system.

## Additional Information

The Fitbit privacy setting **My Friends** (Private, Friends Only or Public)
determines the access to a user's list of friends.

### Inviting friends

Fitbit does not offer endpoints that can send or respond to friend invitation
requests. The Fitbit user must send friend requests through the mobile
application or Fitbit.com. See [How do I connect with friends on
Fitbit?](https<nolink>://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1858.htm)

## Additional Information

### Revoked tokens

Users have granular control over read/write access to their data through the
Fitbit Web API. When a user revokes consent to your application, their access
token becomes invalid and your access to that user's data through the Web API
is no longer available. What you do with the data that has already been
collected should be clearly documented in your Terms of Service and Privacy
Policy. Any guidelines or requirements defined by Fitbit will be specified in
our [Platform Terms of Service](https://dev.fitbit.com/legal/platform-terms-
of-service/).

### Revoking refresh tokens

When a `/oauth2/revoke` request is made with a refresh_token that is not
present in our database, the service will respond with an HTTP status code of
404 (NOT_FOUND).
